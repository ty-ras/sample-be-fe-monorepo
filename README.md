# Typesafe REST API Specification Sample - Backend & Frontend Monorepo

The Typesafe REST API Specification (TyRAS) is a family of libraries used to enable seamless development of Backend and/or Frontend which communicate via HTTP protocol.
The protocol specification is checked both at compile-time and run-time to verify that communication indeed adhers to the protocol.
This all is done in such way that it does not make development tedious or boring, but instead robust and fun!

This particular repository contains sample setup on having backend and frontend in the same repo.
The synergies of agile development of communication protcol between backend and frontend are fully utilized, as both are written in TypeScript.
Having both in TypeScript is not a requirement to use TyRAS tho - the benefits related to compile- and runtime safety are obtained already when one of them is written in TypeScript and using TyRAS libraries.
